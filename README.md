Refactor Code

#About
This is a challenge project associated with Module 1 of the coding bootcamp. We were provided starter code and were asked to refactor the code without changing the appearance of the website. It was important to follow accessibility standards so that the site was optimized for search engines. 
#The Solve
In order to make the site more accessible, I found a few ways in which the code in both the index.html and style.css files could be improved. 
Semantic elements were added. 
The structure of the index.html and the stylesheet were condensed in order to reduce duplicate information. 
Alt attributes to the images were added. 
The heading attributes are in sequential order. 
The title element has a concise and descriptive title.
